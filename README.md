Features:
Crop Recommendations: Suggests crops based on soil texture and rainfall.
Chemical Recommendations: Provides fertilizer recommendations based on soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
Responsive Design: Adaptable layout for various devices.
Interactive Interface: Real-time feedback based on user input.
